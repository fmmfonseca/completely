# Description

*Completely* is a Java autocomplete library.

Autocomplete involves predicting a word or phrase that the user may type based on a partial query. The goal is to provide instant feedback and avoid unnecessary typing as the user formulates queries. Performance is a key issue since each keystroke from the user could invoke a query, and each query should be answered within a few milliseconds. What's more, because users often make spelling mistakes while typing, autocomplete should tolerate errors and differences in representation.

Needless to say, a standard sequential search is bound to be ineffective for anything other than small data sets. By contrast, *Completely* relies on text preprocessing to create an in-memory index for efficiently answering searches in large data sets. All in all, there are three fundamental components at play:

* [Analyzer](https://github.com/fmmfonseca/completely/tree/master/core/src/main/java/com/miguelfonseca/completely/text/analyze) function to filter, tokenize and/or transform text prior to indexing;
* [Index](https://github.com/fmmfonseca/completely/tree/master/core/src/main/java/com/miguelfonseca/completely/text/index) data structure for storing the mapping of text to the corresponding sources;
* [Automaton](https://github.com/fmmfonseca/completely/tree/master/core/src/main/java/com/miguelfonseca/completely/text/match) engine for text matching when searching;

Together these can used to tackle a variety of use cases, wherein the choice of components or combination thereof depends solely on the application at hand.
